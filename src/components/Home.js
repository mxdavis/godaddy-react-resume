            GoDaddy has an awesome community that encourages teamwork. I thrive in team-based environments, and working in a positive and friendly atmosphere. <br/>
            A recent graduate of Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Online Program, I have a lot of experience working remotely: I am currently a Remote Tech Coach for the Flatiron School, an off-site IT Consultant for a couple of small businesses, and I run a weekly remote JavaScript meetup with friends I made at Flatiron, where we tackle problems on CodeWars together.
            <br/>
            I love learning new things, and being challenged. GoDaddy's innovative environment will keep me learning, and solving new problems.
            <br />
            I'm excited about the opportunity to work in such a creative atmosphere!
