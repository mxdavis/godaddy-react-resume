        <img src={MalkiPic} alt="malki" width='40%' height='40%'/>
        <h3>Born and bred in New York, now living in the Jerusalem Hills, Israel.
           <br/>
            I'm a wife, mother, and Full stack web developer with a background in IT and a passion for coding.
            <br />
            I love problem solving, tackling challenges and learning new things. I work hard and follow through on anything I start until it is completed.
            <br />
            I started my career as an administrative assistant, and worked my way up to head the IT department. As a recent <img src={Graduate} alt="graduate" width='3%' height='3%'/> graduate of the Flatiron School <img src={Flatiron} alt="flatiron" width='2%' height='2%'/>, and with a passion to code <span role="img" aria-label="At Computer">üë©‚Äçüíª</span>‚Äç and learn, I'm looking forward to do the same in software development and have a future of building great things.
            <br />
            When I'm not programming you can find me hanging out with my family, taking trips, baking, and just enjoying the outdoors.
